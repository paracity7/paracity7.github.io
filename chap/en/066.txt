Chapter 66



TL: Hanguk

Chomp, chomp, chomp.

Theo, after telling about Oren and his followers to Sejun, was spending a happy time, lying on Sejun’s lap, relishing the churu that Sejun was feeding him.

“Meow!”

Suddenly, another opportunity to receive praise from Sejun popped into Theo’s head.

And then,

Rustle. Rustle.

“President Park, take a look at this, meow! I picked this, meow!”

Theo, confidently shouting, took a hand axe out of his bag.

“A hand axe?”

It was a hand axe with a short handle and a blade the size of a palm.

“My front paws were strongly attracted to it, meow!”

“Really?”

At Theo’s words, Sejun hurriedly inspected the hand axe.

[Hand Axe]

→ ???

→ Usage Restriction: Lv. 20, Strength 15 or above

→ Creator: Confidential

→ Grade: E

[A quest has been generated.]

[Quest: Give the unappraised hand axe to the Great Black Dragon, Aileen Pritani.]

Reward: None

Refusal: Cannot appraise

[An additional quest has been generated.]

[Quest: Serve SeP’s cherry tomato soup to the Great Black Dragon, Aileen Pritani.]

Reward: Appraised hand axe

Refusal: Unable to obtain the hand axe.

Aileen was watching, she created a quest before Sejun could request an appraisal.

“Here.”

The hand axe disappeared from Sejun’s hand.

[The Tower’s Administrator uses an appraisal skill on the hand axe.]

[The Tower’s Administrator says it’s a pretty decent item.]

A pretty decent item? With Aileen’s high standards for items, Sejun’s expectation for the hand axe item grew.

The ring that Theo had brought before through the draw received a harsh assessment from Aileen, saying that the appraisal magic was a waste on it.

‘Well, that was to be expected.’

The appraised ring was a D-grade item, with a cursed option that had a certain chance of stealing sight.

He was going to give the ring to Aileen to destroy, but Iona wanted it. She wanted it as a research item for studying curse magic. So he sold it to her for a cheap price of 10 tower coins.

[The Tower’s Administrator smacks her lips, asking for SeP’s cherry tomato soup.]

“Okay. Just a moment.”

Holding Theo in his arms, Sejun went to the kitchen to taste the soup to see if it was ready.

Slurp.

“Mmm.”

The long-simmered, tender red locust meat and cherry tomatoes blended well with Sejun’s seasoning, enhancing the flavor of the soup.

“Here, take this.”

Along with Sejun’s words, the soup, filled to the brim in three large pots, disappeared.

[You have completed the quest.]

[You have acquired the appraised hand axe – Great Warrior Uka’s Throwing Hand Axe as a reward for completing the quest.]

“Great Warrior Uka?”

It was a named item. Sejun checked the hand axe’s option with anticipation.

[Great Warrior Uka’s Throwing Hand Axe]

→ This is a throwing hand axe personally made and used by the dwarf great warrior Uka.

→ The well-balanced weight of the hand axe increases its destructive power and it flies further when thrown.

→ The blade has been finished with mithril powder, maintaining its sharpness for a long time.

→ Usage Restriction: Lv 20 or above, Strength 15 or above, Magic 15 or above.

→ Creator: Blacksmith Uka (Red Rock Dwarf Tribe)

→ Grade: A

→ Skills: [Splitting Cut Lv. 1], [Retrieval Lv. 3]

[Splitting Cut Lv. 1]

→ You can split better with less force when using the hand axe.

[Retrieval Lv. 3]

→ You can teleport a thrown hand axe back to your hand once every 10 seconds within a 300m radius.

It was already uncomfortable fighting the Branch Scouts with Keinz’s training dagger…

“With this, fighting the Branch Scouts will be easier.”

Sejun gripped the hand axe tightly. The grip felt just right, as if the weight was perfectly balanced as described in the item’s details.

Unlike the last time, Theo had pulled out a truly excellent item.

“You did well, Theo.”

Smooch.

Sejun was so pleased that he pecked Theo’s forehead.

“Meow?!”

[…!!!]

Two beings were shocked by Sejun’s peck.

“Meow! What are you doing?!”

Theo quickly groomed his forehead where Sejun had pecked him with his paw, and

[The Tower’s Administrator is upset that your lips are now impure.]

Aileen also became angry with Sejun, claiming that his lips were now impure.

“What’s wrong with my lips…”

Sejun was hurt by their attitudes.

That’s when

[The cooldown of Growth Acceleration Lv. 1 has ended.]

Thirty days had passed since he used Growth Acceleration, so he could use the skill again.

“Great! Let’s use it on Flamie!”

And he went to find Flamie, who always welcomed him affectionately.

[Master! Welcome!]

Flamie greeted Sejun with a cheery voice.

“Okay, Growth Acceleration.”

Sejun immediately used the skill on Flamie.

[You used Growth Acceleration Lv. 1.]

[The potential of the apple tree is tremendous.]

[All of the growth acceleration of 10 crops will be used on the apple tree.]

All ten?!

Sejun was surprised and looked at Flamie, who was covered in bright light.

[Oh! Master! I’m brimming with energy! Yaap!!!]

Flamie shouted with a yell.

And then,

Poof.

After absorbing all the growth acceleration of 10 crops, Flamie sprouted one more leaf on his body.

—

Floor 67 of the Tower.

“Attack!”

“Waa!”

At the battle cry of the Lizardman Great Warrior Tamuro, the Lizardmen and mercenaries rushed toward the Red Locusts.

Twice a day, they stepped out of the defense area made of sturdy blade onion leaves to kill the Red Locusts.

The reason was to gather the bodies of the Red Locusts killed by the sturdy blade onion leaves on a cart and replace the wilted sturdy blade onion leaves.

Thud, thud.

The Red Locusts, who were eating the bodies of their kin, flapped their wings and charged at them.

“Hurry up!”

Tamuro, who had cut five Red Locusts at once with his giant greatsword, yelled.

“Yes!”

The Lizardman transporters loaded the bodies of the Red Locusts onto the carts and pulled out the wilted sturdy blade onion leaves.

And then,

Plunk!

The wolves planted new sturdy blade onion leaves in the ground that they had brought.

“Thanks to Tamuro, the lizardmen who had SeP’s soup before departure could finish the job quickly due to their increased strength.

“Great Warrior Tamuro! The work is done!”

“Good! Start moving the carts first and we’ll retreat slowly!”

At Tamuro’s instruction, the lizardmen made room for the carts to move and prepared to retreat slowly.

Just then,

“Great Warrior Tamuro! Five swarms of Red Locusts are approaching from the front!”

A lizardman scout who was scouting the area ran to report to Tamuro.

“What?! Hurry and request support from the rear!”

The pattern of the Red Locusts, which always moved in a certain size, had changed.

***

After making another leaf bloom on Flamie, Sejun had lunch and

“Could you send a message to Minotaur King for me?”

Uh-uh!

He asked Woocheon Sam (1003) to ask him to scare the cats, who were soon to arrive, but not harm them.

Then Sejun started farming in the afternoon.

“Meow. Meow.”

“Move aside.”

Sejun, who was cutting the green onion leaves, told Theo, who was rubbing his face around his mouth and blocking his view, to move.

However,

“Meow. Meow. Give me a kiss, meow.”

Theo, who had just realized that Sejun’s earlier kiss was a sign of praise, was annoyingly rubbing his forehead against Sejun’s mouth.

“That’s enough.”

Sejun, who was already upset, placed Theo on his knee and started to cut the leaves again.

Just then,

[You’ve obtained 1.1mL of the honey from the cherry tomato flower.]

[Your Beekeeping Lv. 3 proficiency increases slightly .]

[The proficiency of Beekeeping Lv. 3 is filled, and the level rises.]

The level of Beekeeping skill increased.

Then

Buzz. Buzz

About 1300 poisonous honeybees flew to Sejun.

“President Park, I’m sorry, meow!”

Theo, thinking Sejun had called the poisonous honeybees to scold him, quickly hid in Sejun’s shirt.

“Hey! Come out!”

“No! I don’t want to, meow!”

Sejun, who had managed to remove Theo, who was clinging to his back and refusing to get off, put him back on his knee, and asked the poisonous honeybees,

“What’s the matter?”

Buzz.

When Sejun asked, one poisonous honeybee sat on the back of his hand.

And then

Buzz.

[Please instruct which flower to collect nectar from for making honey jelly.]

“Honey jelly?”

Surprised by the sudden words of the poisonous honeybees, Sejun checked his Beekeeping skill, which had just leveled up.

[Special Job Skill – Beekeeping Lv. 4]

→ Able to keep bees when you own a beehive.

→ The activity area of the honey bees in the owned hive slightly increases.

→  The speed at which the queen bee lays eggs slightly increases.

→  The speed and amount of honey collected by the bees slightly increases.

→  The probability of pollination slightly increases.

→  You can produce honey jelly with special effects. (Currently, honey jelly can only be made from the honey and pollen collected from a single type of flower.)

→  Currently owned beehives (3/4): 3 Poisonous Honey Bee Hives

Could he make honey jelly with special effects?! Sejun looked at the new description of the Beekeeping skill and fell into thought.

“For now, hive 1 and 2 make honey jelly from cherry tomato flowers.”

“Since cherry tomatoes are plentiful, they were assigned to Beehive No.1 and No.2, both containing numerous honeybees.

And

“Beehive No.3, please take care of the peanut flowers and the rest of the flowers.”

Beehive No.3, which has fewer bees, was given the responsibility of the peanut field and the rest of the plants.

Buzz. Buzz.

Upon receiving Sejun’s instructions, the honeybees flew off to their respective locations.

“I wonder what kind of honey jelly will come out.”

Rustle. Rustle.

While Sejun was thinking about honey jelly and cutting green onion leaves, it was time for dinner.

“Let’s eat.”

Dinner was SeP’s carrot soup.

Squeak!

Squeak!

Squeak!

The rabbits were excited about the soup with carrots.

After finishing the soup,

[You have consumed the standard portion of Combat Rations – SeP’s Carrot Soup.]

[Your agility will increase by 7.1 for 30 minutes.]

[You will feel full for 3 hours.]

His agility had increased.

“Let’s work quickly and rest.”

These days, to grow the landlord’s talent, Sejun and the rabbits have been expanding the field by 1000 square meter before bedtime, this was exactly the effect they needed.

[You have created a 1,000-square meter cherry tomato field.]

[You have gained 2,000 experience points.]

With their increased agility, Sejun and the rabbits finished their work in an hour, made the 1,000-square meter cherry tomato field, and after finishing the day’s work fell asleep.

***

Growl!

Dawn of Day 240 of being stranded.

The roar of the mother Crimson Giant Bear woke Sejun up. A branch scout had invaded.

“Alright!”

Sejun got up energetically, thinking of trying out the newly acquired Great Warrior Uka’s Throwing Hand Axe. He picked up Theo and the black rabbit in both hands and ran towards where the battle was happening.

Grr!

Thud! Thump!

Upon Sejun’s arrival, Cuengi, who was cutting off the limbs of the large branch scout, greeted Sejun.

“Did you sleep well, Cuengi? Let’s go, guys!”

Sejun greeted Cuengi and shouted.

“President Park, you can count me, meow!”

Shush.

Theo, revealing his sharp claws hidden in his front paws, climbed and defeated the bodies of the large branch scouts,

Squeak!

Bong! Bong! Bong!

The black rabbit swung its hammer hard, sweeping away the small branch scouts on the ground.

Meanwhile, while Theo and the black rabbit were taking action.

Thud!

[You have defeated the Corrupted Ent’s large branch scout.]

[You have gained 500 experience points.]

…

..

.

Sejun, who had taken down all the large branch scouts that Cuengi had prepared.

‘Shall I throw it once?’

When there were no more enemies to defeat, he threw the hand axe powerfully towards the large branch scout approaching from about 50 meters away.

Whooong!

The axe cut through the air with force and was embedded in the center of the large branch scout’s body.

Thud!

Crack.

[You attacked the knot.] (TL Note: https://treeterms.co.uk/files/definitions/knot/#:~:text=A%20feature%20of%20wood%20arising,becomes%20incorporated%20into%20the%20wood)

[Splitting Lv.1 is activated and splitting is successful.]

[You have defeated the Corrupted Ent’s large branch scout.]

[You have gained 500 experience points.]

“Oh!”

The large branch scout fell, split in half with one attack that hit the knot.

“Retrieve.”

Using the retrieval skill, the axe suddenly returned to Sejun’s hand.

Whooong.

Sejun, having gained confidence, attacked another large branch scout again. And Cuengi, watching Sejun fighting from behind, nodded his head.

Dad could now do about 1/100th of what he could. In other words, from Cuengi’s point of view, Sejoon now had 0.01 of combat power.

Krooong!

Delighted at Sejun’s growth, Cuengi swung his front paw fiercely towards the branch scouts without worrying about his dad.

Roar!

With a swung filled with Cuengi’s sincerity, the enemies within a 10-meter radius in front were cleanly annihilated.
