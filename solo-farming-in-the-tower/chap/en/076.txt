Chapter 76
TL: Hanguk

When Theo suddenly came out of Izrael’s warehouse and started running,

“Representative Theo, where are you going?!”

Elka also ran following Theo and asked.

“I feel President Park’s lap nearby, meow!”

“What?!”

“It’s in that direction, meow! It’s getting closer, meow!”

Theo climbed onto Elka’s head, grabbed her ears, and shouted.

“Okay!”

Although Elka was puzzled by Theo’s words about finding Sejun’s lap, which should be on the 99th floor of the tower, Theo’s voice was full of conviction.

“Hold on tight!”

For now, Elka ran in the direction Theo was pointing.

****

Prog 1231/2291

“About a thousand left?”

As Sejun checked the number of remaining progs and muttered,

“Hey guys! Mr. Sejun says there are still about a thousand progs left! Hurry and catch them!”

Hegel, who was next to him, was focusing on Sejun’s every move and shouted to the black wolves.

“Yes!”

Squeak!

Kroung!

Having found the joy of hunting in a group with the 300 black wolves, the black rabbit and the Cuengi responded together.

Hunting progs by surrounding them from a distance was a new experience for the black rabbit and the Cuengi, who always hunted alone.

The wolves brought the frogs they caught through group hunting to the surface and put them in front of Sejun.

Thud!

[You have defeated the Prog.]

[You have earned 500 experience points.]

[You leveled up.]

[You earned 1 bonus stat.]

Sejun comfortably gained experience points and reached level 30.

And

[A quest has been generated.]

[Job Quest: Plant a new crop you have never planted before.]

Reward: Level 31 unlock, 500 Tower coins.

A level 30 job quest appeared.

“A new crop I’ve never planted?”

Sejun looked at the quest and thought for a moment.

“Ah! I have that!”

He dug the ground with his dagger, took out the pineapple crown he had saved after eating a pineapple, and planted it.

[You have planted a pineapple crown.]

[Due to the effect of Seed Sowing Lv. 4, the probability of the pineapple crown taking root increases.]

[Due to the effect of Seed Sowing Lv. 4, the probability of pest damage decreases slightly.]

[Your job experience has increased slightly.]

[Your proficiency of Sowing Lv. 4 slightly increases.]

[Due to the effect of Proficiency Increase Lv. 1, your proficiency Sowing Lv. 4 has increased by an additional 5%.]

[You have completed the quest.]

[Level 31 has been unlocked as a quest completion reward.]

[You have obtained 500 Tower coins as a quest completion reward.]

“Hehehe. I got lucky with this quest.”

If he hadn’t found the pineapple, he could have been in a situation where he couldn’t level up until the seed shop opened.

Fortunately, he completed the job quest right away this time without losing a single experience point.

While Sejun was again gaining experience by defeating the progs brought by the wolves,

Rustle.

There was a noise as the bushes shook.

And then,

“I found you, meow!!”

Something yellow sprang out from beyond the bushes.

“Huh?! President Theo?!”

Theo, who had arrived at Zenka Lake by using his lap detector at full power, jumped off Elka’s back towards Sejun.

Thud.

Sejun caught the flying Theo with both hands. He was very warm and soft.

“President Park, nice to see you, meow. When did you get here, meow?!”

Theo casually lifted his front paws and asked in greeting.

“What? President Theo, how did you know I was here?”

He had heard from Hegel that Theo was nearby, but he didn’t expect him to come so early.

“I have my ways, meow!”

Theo sat proudly on Sejun’s lap, claiming it for himself.

And then,

Flick.

He took out two contracts and handed them to Sejun. One was a contract with the Black Wolf Tribe, and the other was a contract stating that he would receive 5000 tower coins from Izrael and Oren.

Theo had calculated the value of his own life, the lives of the wolves, and Iona, and demanded 25,000 tower coins from Izrael and Oren as compensation.

However, their assets were short by about 5000 tower coins.

“Pay off the rest with your body, meow!”

Theo made Izrael and Oren sign a contract to repay the remaining money through labor. Theo was good at applying what he learned from Sejun.

“Did I do well, meow?”

“Yes, but did you pick three items from Izrael’s house?”

“I haven’t chosen them yet, meow…”

Theo answered while looking at Sejun’s face, worrying he might be sent back.

“Is that so? Then pick them next time.”

After all, all of Izrael’s house and all the items in it had been transferred to Sejun through the contract. He could pick any time.

“I got it, meow! I’ll pick next time, meow!”

Relieved by Sejun’s words, Theo comfortably lay on Sejun’s lap.

And then,

Zzz.

He fell asleep in no time.

***

As the number of remaining progs decreased, the wolves’ speed of bringing progs slowed down.

And when the number of remaining frogs dropped below 100, the frogs scattered and hid, and the black wolves, the black rabbits, and Cuengi also dispersed to find the progs.

As the boring search continued, the black rabbits and Cuengi began to explore Zenka Lake instead of looking for progs.

Thud!

Squeak!

Kroung!

The black rabbits and Cuengi poured out the treasures they found in Zenka Lake in front of Sejun and bragged.

Most of them were trinkets like rocks or bone fragments, but they were fascinating treasures that stimulated the imagination for the black rabbits and Cuengi.

“Wow! Great! Guys, go find more treasures.”

Squeak!

Kroung!

Encouraged by Sejun, the black rabbits and Cuengi entered Zenka Lake with a determined mindset to find better treasures.

***

[A quest for the Mid-level Administrator has been generated.]

“Hehehe! Let’s see what quest have been given to the interesting human?”

Aileen checked Sejun’s quest.

And then,

“Hmph! I don’t like it!”

Aileen frowned after checking Sejun’s quest. The quest reward was too pitiful. She had already forgotten the quest she had given to Sejun in the past.

“I have to ask Dad how to change the quest reward.”

Since Anton had taught Aileen how to sync with the black dragon statue through the orb, direct conversation was now possible.

“Dad.”

She called Anton through the black dragon statue.

-Oh! My granddaughter! Have you been well?!

It was Kaiser who responded happily, perhaps Anton was away at the moment.

“Yes, Grandpa, I have a question.”

-Hahahaha! Ask me anything! Grandpa will tell you everything! But, Aileen, you missed your grandpa, right?

“Huh?! Yes! Of course, I missed you. Grandpa, can you teach me how to change the quest reward?”

-Hahahaha! Grandpa missed you so much too, Aileen. You want to change the quest reward?

“Yes.”

-Heh! What are you planning to give to that Sejun fellow this time?!

Recalling that Aileen’s 100th birthday fountain had been handed over to Sejun as a quest reward, Kaiser’s voice rose.

However,

“Grandpa. Are you mad at me?!”

As Aileen’s voice hardened,

– Ah…no! How could I… Now, let me explain in detail!

The voice of Kaiser, the superpower of the Pritani family, changed to its original, no, softer than before.

After learning about the method of changing quests for several hours from Kaiser,

“Change the reward.”

As she learned from Kaiser, she raised her hand over the quest window and began to change the quest reward with her will and mana.

She raised the reward experience from 10,000 to 100 million and the Tower coins from 1,000 to 10 million. The reward was increased ten thousand times. Aileen was quite generous.

However,

[You cannot change the reward of the Mid-level Administrator’s quest.]

[The level of Tower Farmer Park Sejun is too low.]

Sejun’s level was too low.

“Argh! Then let’s make it 1000 times!”

Aileen removed a zero and changed the quest reward again, but 1000 times, 100 times, and even 10 times were too high for Sejun.

“Then, 7 times!”

[You cannot change the reward of the Mid-level Administrator’s quest.]

[The level of Tower Farmer Park Sejun is low.]

However, once she went below 10 times, the word ‘too’ was removed.

And then,

“5 times!”

“2 times!”

“1.5 times!”

Finally, the quest reward was changed.

“Heheh, I wish the interesting human would get stronger quickly.”

Aileen was sad that she couldn’t give more to Sejun even though she wanted to.

***

[The reward for the Mid-level Administrator’s quest has been changed from 10,000 experience to 15,000.]

[The reward for the Mid-level Administrator’s quest has been changed from 1,000 Tower coins to 1,500.]

“Huh?”

While the wolves were slowing down in catching the progs and he was idly looking at the lake, Sejun, who had fallen asleep, woke up due to a sudden message that the quest reward had been changed.

“Did Aileen do something?”

To Sejun’s knowledge, the only being capable of such a thing was Aileen.

Thus, Sejun, who regained his senses, looked around.

And then,

“What are all these?”

Sejun found a pile of miscellaneous items stacked almost 10m high in front of him. The black rabbit and Cuengi had unknowingly gathered this much treasure.

“Should I check out what they’ve brought?”

Just as Sejun was about to examine if there was anything useful,

“Tweet, tweet, tweet.”

Iona flew over singing a song. She had come to finalize the contest with her victory, having received Theo’s admission of defeat.

“Oh?! It’s Sejun, nice to see you!”

Realizing Sejun’s presence a little late, Iona greeted him.

“But what is that?”

He asked about the transparent liquid in a glass bottle floating around Iona.

“Oh! This? It’s a contract nullification potion that I found in Izreal’s warehouse.”

“Contract nullification potion?”

“Yes. If you spray it on a contract, you can nullify the contract.”

“Is that so?”

“Yes. Take a look.”

[Contract Nullification Potion]

→ A potion that can nullify the agreement of a contract.

→ When the contract nullification potion is sprinkled on the contract, the contract is nullified.

→ It is impossible to nullify the contract if the party who proposed the contract has a high level or the contract has been in effect for more than 100 days.

→ Grade: B

‘So, there’s such a thing.’

He thought that once the contract was done in the tower, it would be final…

“Are there many such contract nullification potions?”

“No. This is the first time I’ve seen it myself.”

At Iona’s response, Sejun was relieved.

Still, he thought he should prepare for the case of contract nullification in the future and checked the contracts he had.

As Sejun was checking the contracts,

“Representative Theo, wake up.”

Iona woke up Theo, lifting his eyelids.

“Meow? What, meow? Iona, I want to sleep more, meow…”

“Then I won the contest, right?”

“Meow?!”

“The contest to find better items. I won, right?”

At Iona’s words, Theo’s eyes snapped open.

“No, meow! Victory is mine, meow!”

Theo jumped up and declared, feeling invincible while being on Sejun’s lap. He believed he could never lose.

“Tweet, tweet, tweet. But I’ve already found a B-grade item, and and you haven’t found anything yet.”

Iona spoke confidently of her victory.

“The contest is not over yet, meow!”

Theo shouted at Iona, focusing all his attention on his front paw. He was planning to find an item to beat Iona quickly.

Then

Zing.

Theo felt a strong pull on his front paw.

‘Puhuhut. Of course, I can’t lose even if I want to, meow!’

Following the pull,

Plunk.

Theo began to rummage through the pile of random items that the black rabbit and Cuengi had stacked, putting his paw in it.

And then

‘Got it, meow!’

“Puhuhut. Iona, the victory is mine, meow!”

Just as Theo pulled out an item he had grabbed from the pile of random items with his paw, confident of his victory,

Thud.

“Meow?”

The pile of random items collapsed down onto Theo’s head.
