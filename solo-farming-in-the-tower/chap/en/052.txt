Chapter 52

TL: Hanguk

Aileen was recently engrossed in the fun of feeling the beating of the Dragon Heart on her own. The Dragon Heart was beating even if she didn’t eat anything.

Thump…

“Oh! It’s beating!”

Thud…

“It’s beating again!”

Although very slow, it was steadily beating. Although the pulse was too weak to accumulate mana, Aileen was very happy just that the Dragon Heart was beating.

“This is all thanks to the amazing human! Anyway, what is the amazing human doing? I, Aileen Pritani, the great black dragon, need to take care of him…”

As her thoughts turned to Sejun, Aileen became curious what he was doing. He might have been using potentially dangerous unidentified items in the meantime. Or he might be eating something delicious alone…

“No way! I can’t forgive that!”

Eating something delicious without her! The mere thought made her angry.

At that time,

“Huh?”

[Achievement: Recreation of the forgotten dish, Potato Mat-Tang, has been achieved in the tower.]

[Achievement: Recreation of the forgotten dish, Mat-Tang, has been achieved in the tower.]

“Hehehe. He’s recreating a new dish for me! That amazing human did something amazing again! I should ask for it right away!”

Aileen hurriedly ran to the crystal ball.

However,

[There are over 1,000 unread alerts.]

[Please organize your alerts.]

The crystal ball’s alarm interrupted Aileen.

“Argh! I’m busy!”

Aileen quickly skipped the alarms without even reading them. Among them, there were red alerts warning of danger, but she quickly skipped them, determined to eat the new dish as soon as possible.

And then,

“Hehehe. Let me, Aileen Pritani, the great black dragon, see what the amazing human has made?”

Aileen hurriedly checked through the crystal ball to see what Sejun was eating.

***

When Sejun’s stomach was somewhat full,

[The tower’s Administrator has come, drooling at the rumors of the Mat-Tang and Potato Mat-Tang.]

A message from Aileen appeared.

“You should have answered when I called you earlier. It’s all cold now.”

[The tower’s Administrator says they were busy.]

“Alright. Give me a quest.”

[A quest has been generated.]

[Quest: Serve the Mat-Tang dish and Potato Mat-Tang dish to the tower’s Administrator.]

Reward: Aileen eats the food very deliciously.

If declined: Aileen will be very disappointed.

“There are pots covered with lids in the cave. You can take that.”

With Sejun’s words, the quest was completed.

[The tower’s Administrator is very grateful for letting her eat something delicious.]

[The tower’s Administrator says it’s so sweet and she’s full of energy.]

Full of energy? It must be because she ate the power sweet potato and power potato. Sejun and the animals were also overflowing with energy right now.

“That’s right. Eat a lot.”

After lunch and a nap with Theo, the Black Rabbit, and Cuengi, Sejun started planting the remaining sweet potato stems that he couldn’t finish in the morning.

In the afternoon, other rabbits who had finished their own work joined together to plant sweet potato sprouts, quickly completing the sweet potato field.

[You have created a 2,500 square meter sweet potato field.]

[You have gained 5,000 experience points.]

“Phew. That’s done. Now onto the onion field…”

Just as Sejun was about to move to the onion field,

Peng!

The black rabbit called Sejun to pull up the aquatic products.

“Got it.”

As Sejun went down to the cave, he saw something he hadn’t seen before in front of the pond. It was a net made of straw.

“Did you guys make this?”

When Sejun asked while looking at the gray rabbits,

Beep!

Bilik!

Bimik!

Pyong!

“Huh?!”

Among the gray rabbits nodding in response to Sejun’s question, there was also a single red dotted rabbit. To be precise, it was sticking right next to the architect rabbit.

He wanted to ask what had happened with the sickle rabbit, but it was still young. At this age, its mind would go back and forth several times a day.

Instead, he thought that he should give a carrot to the sickle rabbit as a sign of comfort when,

Thump!

Peng!

The black rabbit called Sejun as it went into the pond with the net. I’m going in now!

“Okay!”

Sejun grabbed the rope.

A moment later,

Peng! Peng!

There was a signal to pull the rope twice.

“Hoist!”

The net was so heavy that it must have caught a lot. Sejun pulled up the net with all his might. Fortunately, from the middle, the black rabbit helped reduce the weight by moving the aquatic products caught in the net to the pond.

In this way, about 100 piranhas and crayfish were pulled up with the net. It was tough, but it was easier to catch aquatic products than before.

“Let’s do it a few more times.”

Peng!

At Sejun’s words, the black rabbit went into the water without delay. Although 100 were enough, even with the low water temperature, there was a limit to preventing spoilage, so it seemed best to eat them quickly.

Moreover, they always lacked food for the Crimson Giant Bear and baby bear. There was no need to worry about leftovers.

Thus, the baby bear and the mother Crimson Giant Bear were able to fill their bellies with the meal served by Sejun.

Grrrrr.

Grrrrr.

Grrrrr.

Grrrrr.

Thump, thump.

After having a hearty dinner, the happy mother Crimson Giant Bear and the cub cheerfully returned home.

Sejun went fishing for aquatic products with the black rabbit again. The catch was to be given to the wolves of the Silver Wolf tribe.

In the meantime, under Sejun’s instructions, the gray rabbits made bags out of straw for the wolves to carry.

They made bags that could be carried on both sides of the body, planning to use them for Theo’s journey later on.

The wolves took the piranhas, crayfish, and chunks of eel in these bags and went down to the 85th floor of the tower. Since they had to depart for a journey with Theo tomorrow morning, there was no time but today.

And so, a busy day passed.

***

“Kooeung!”

Today, as usual, Cuengi announced his arrival with a powerful cry.

“Alright.”

Whoosh.

Sejun added a line to the cave wall, starting the 215th day of being stranded.

“It’s already the day the seed store opens. I wonder what will appear?”

Sejun prepared for the day, anticipating what seeds he would buy.

Gulp.

He started the day simply with some sweet potatoes and a few cherry tomatoes for breakfast. His plan for the day was to plant potatoes.

Thud. Thud.

Sejun placed potatoes on a flat rock he found above ground, then proceeded to cut them.

“The eyes have to be attached like this, right?”

Instead of cutting the potatoes into exact quarters, he cut them into 2 to 4 pieces of an appropriate size so the eyes of the potatoes wouldn’t be overly concentrated.

Previously, when he couldn’t communicate with the male rabbit, he couldn’t have a conversation, but after he began to understand the male rabbit, he was able to learn more detailed farming knowledge.

Whirr.

Sejun scooped the potato seeds he cut into a cross bag made of straw. The grey rabbits were skilled with their hands, so they could make it as similar as possible to the style Sejun wanted.

Thus, next to the sweet potato field he planted yesterday, Sejun started planting the potato seeds.

Of course, he asked Cuengi to clear away the straw covering the empty field.

Kooeung!

Cuengi was pleased to be given a job by Sejun and vigorously fluttered the straw. To be precise, he was happy about the honey he would get after finishing the task.

Poke.

Sejun made a hole in the ground with his dagger, took a potato seed from the cross bag, and planted it so the eyes were facing upwards. As the amount of seeds that could fit in the cross bag wasn’t that large, Sejun went back and forth planting the potatoes earnestly.

And when he planted about half of the potatoes,

[Seed shop is now open.]

[Your level is Ordinary.]

[Four types of seeds for sale today will be displayed randomly.]

[At your current level, you can buy as many seeds as you want within the limit 5 Tower Coins.]

The Seed Store opened and the seeds available for purchase today appeared.

[Flame Bean Seed x1 – 5 Tower Coins]

[Carrot Seed x20,000 – 4 Tower Coins]

[Strawberry Seed 100pcs – 0.5 Tower Coins]

[Green Pepper Seed x100 – 0.5 Tower Coins]

“Flame Bean Seed?”

It was a whopping 5 Tower Coins for just one seed. Even though he had enough money, he could only buy within the limit of 5 Tower Coins, so if he bought the Flame Bean Seed, he wouldn’t be able to buy anything else.

“Hmm… I should stick with what I know.”

Sejun’s pondering was brief. He decided to buy multiple items he knew well rather than buying one thing he was unfamiliar with.

[You have purchased 20,000 Carrot Seeds.]

[You have purchased 100 Strawberry Seeds.]

[You have purchased 100 Green Pepper Seeds.]

[5 Tower Coins have been deducted from your Seed Bank account.]

[You have earned 50 seed Shop loyalty points.]

[You now have a total of 56 seed Shop loyalty points.]

Clink!

Three leather pouches containing seeds appeared in Sejun’s hand.

[Thank you for using the seed shop.]

[You can use Seed Shop Lv. 2 again in 30 days.]

“I’ve got a lot to plant now.”

His workload had increased, but Sejun’s face was bright. Imagining eating strawberries and green peppers gave him a surge of energy.

“I’ll leave the carrot seeds to the rabbits.”

There was a vast field prepared by the Black Minotaurs and Shovel Rabbits over the past few days, and given the rabbits’ passion for carrots, they would plant all the carrot seeds even if it meant cutting back on sleep.

Thus, when Sejun had planted all 4,000 potatoes and finished planting strawberries and green peppers in the cave

“Mr. Sejun, we’ve arrived.”

The wolves had returned after delivering food to the wolves on the 85th floor of the tower.

“Take a break.”

Sejun let the wolves who had traveled all the way to the 85th floor of the tower rest for a while, and he separated the bags carried by the wolves and took them down to the cave.

And then,

“Representative Theo.”

Sejun called Theo, who was busily eating Churu in the corner.

“What’s up, meow? Is it break time, meow?”

Theo, who had been eating Churu, ran towards Sejun’s lap.

“No, let’s pack this together.”

Sejun picked up Theo, who was hanging on his knee, and walked to the storage. Then, together with Theo, they packed the cherry tomatoes he had harvested yesterday into a bag.

The bag carried by the wolves didn’t have a preservation spell like Theo’s bag, so they packed it with the most recently harvested ones.

In this way, they re-equipped the wolves with six bags, each containing 100 cherry tomatoes.

“Take care, Representative Theo.”

“I got it, meow! We’ll sell out again, meow! Subordinates, let’s go now, meow!”

“Mr. Sejun, we’ll be back.”

“Alright. Elka, Bol, Kish, you guys take care too.”

Theo and the wolves went down the tower with Sejun’s farewell.

“Phew, now it’s time to prepare lunch.”

Sejun went to the pond and with Black Rabbit, they scooped up Piranhas and Crayfish with a net.

Though still edible, unlike yesterday, the eyes of the piranha seemed a bit cloudy which suggested that they were starting to decompose. He felt the need to hurry. Though food poisoning wouldn’t be a problem with detoxifying green onions available, he didn’t want to risk eating spoiled food.

“But I don’t want to eat it that bad.”

Thinking this, Sejun pulled up the net.

“Splash!”

What was brought up in the net this time was a chunks of eel flesh.

Black Rabbit went into the pond, took a breath, and went back out again.

Then, when a small piece of eel was cut with Sejun’s dagger and put in a hole, the other rabbits took the eel to grill it.

Afterwards, Black Rabbit only brought up chunks of eel in the net.

“Does Black Rabbit want to eat eel?”

As Sejun thought this,

“What?! Ugh!”

Pang!!

The rope connected to the net began to be pulled strongly, enough to drag Sejun’s body.
