Chapter 94
TL: Hanguk

“Elka, how did you know I was here?”

Sejun asked Elka. He had moved to the 67th floor of the tower without telling anyone.

“I heard it from the golden bat.”

“Ah…”

Sejun realized he had forgotten about the golden bat.

Perhaps because the golden bat had been imprisoned for a long time, it liked to hide in dark places, and Sejun often forgot about its existence. The golden bat had a weak presence.

Then,

Creak. Creak.

Following the wolves, the lizard men entered.

“Sejun, this is Tamuro, the lizardman great warrior in charge of the 67th floor of the tower.”

Elka introduced Sejun to a lizardman who was a head taller than the others.

“Hello. I am Tamuro!”

Tamuro greeted Sejun at a 90-degree bow. He had heard from Elka that he would meet the great black dragon and wanted to show his best side.

But the timing was off.

“How can you manage the 67th floor like this, meow?! Our President Park, is suffering because of you, meow!”

Theo, who had climbed onto Sejun’s lap in a state of exhaustion, berated Tamuro. He looked ready to hit him with his front paws at any moment.

Then,

Squeak?!

Kreung?!

Following their big brother, Black rabbit and Cuengi scolded Tamuro. They tried to intimidate Tamuro by placing a hammer and a branch on their shoulders to intimidate him.

‘What is this?’

Tamuro was taken aback, being bossed around by these little ones in front of the great black dragon. However, he couldn’t get angry because of the black dragon.

However, if he had known that the only one who couldn’t beat him here was Sejun, he would have been even more taken aback.

Then,

“Kyoo-Kyoo-Tamuro, how did you manage this floor? The numbers of Red Locusts were definitely decreasing thanks to Sejun’s sturdy blade green onion leaves”

Iona, the Chairman of the Wizard’s Association, interrogated Tamuro.

“I apologize. Actually…”

Facing Iona, who was in her second rage stage, Tamuro could not dare to lie. He bowed his head and said that he had received money from Tariq, the head of the Chow Group, and allowed him to operate individually.

“So every time Tariq went out with other wandering merchants, the number of red locusts increased dramatically?”

“Yes. I don’t know why he would do such a crazy thing, but it seems like he’s feeding the Red Locusts.”

“Are you sure about that? Is there any evidence or witnesses that Tariq fed the red locusts?”

Iona asked in detail. Tariq, who led the Chow Group, was one of the board members with significant influence in the Wandering Merchant Association.

Without evidence or witnesses, if she, the Chairman of the Wizard’s Association, attacked a wandering merchant from the Wandering Merchant Association, the situation could get messy.

“Well… there’s none.”

He hadn’t thought of making evidence, and for the sake of monopolizing the money, he didn’t make any other witnesses.

Then,

“If there’s no evidence or witness, then make one. But listen…”

Sejun, who had been listening, spoke.

Snap.

Sejun reached out his hand to Tamuro.

“…?”

“Hand over all the money you’ve received from Tariq.”

Sejun and his animals were suffering because of the money Tamuro had received. He intended to take back everything he could.

And then,

Rustle.

Next to Sejun, Theo was pulling out a contract from his bag. He was indeed worthy of being considered Sejun’s successor.

***
Landlord Grid’s office on the 55th floor of the tower.

Bang!

“Why is there still no news?!”

Grid angrily smashed the armrest of his chair. By now, he should have heard news of the locusts moving to the 68th floor of the tower.

“That… That’s because we have indeed spread over 100,000 monster corpses on the 67th floor, and we have confirmed that they have transformed into Purple Locusts. It’s just that the forces on the 67th floor seem to be fighting too well.”

Treading lightly around the furious Grid, Shred, Grid’s right-hand man, answered cautiously.

“What?! Fighting well? Is that what you have to say?!”

“I’m sorry.”

“You incompetent fool! Tell Tariq to spread more monster corpses on the 67th floor immediately!”

“Yes, I understand.”

Upon receiving Grid’s command, Tariq headed back to the 67th floor of the tower.

***

“Alright, manage your subordinate well.”

Sejun handed over the contract signed by Tamuro to Theo.

“Don’t worry, meow! I’ll watch over everything, meow! Tamuro!”

Theo glared at Tamuro and told Sejun.

“Yes…”

‘How did it end up like this?’

As Tamuro was worrying about his bleak future,

[Your crops have exterminated pests.]

[You have gained 1 experience point.]

…

..

.

[You have leveled up.]

[You have gained 1 bonus stat.]

As the detoxifying properties of Sejun’s detoxifying green onion killed the Purple Locusts, Sejun continued to level up.

And then,

[A quest has been generated.]

[Job Quest: Discover the Joy of Harvesting.]

Use the harvesting skill 100,000 times (0/100,000)

Reward: Unlock Level 51, 50,000 tower coins, All Job Skills of Tower Farmer + Lv. 1

He reached level 50.

“Oh!”

The reward of all job skills of Tower Farmer + Lv. 1 caught Sejun’s attention.

Sejun’s current job skills included Seed Sowing Lv. 5, Harvesting Lv. 4, Seed Shop Lv. 2, Seed Harvesting Lv. 3 – a total of four.

While there weren’t any significant benefits from leveling up the Seed Sowing and Harvesting skills, he was excited about the potential of the Seed Shop and Seed Harvesting skills.

Especially in the case of the Seed Shop, the level increase would also increase the grade of the shop, so his expectations were high.

However, in order to receive the reward…

“Ah. 100,000 times harvesting.”

It was a number that made him involuntarily sigh. Even if this was the 99th floor of the tower, it would take 20-30 days to complete.

But this was the 67th floor of the tower. Aside from the detoxifying green onions that Sejun planted, there were practically no crops to harvest in the area where the locusts had swept through.

Then,

[The Purple Locust has devolved into a Red Locust.]

[The quest has been updated.]

[Your past contributions will be reflected in the quest reward.]

[Mid-level Administrator Quest: Exterminate the Purple Locusts of the 67th floor of the tower.]

Red Locusts 0/6,976,212,890

Reward: 1.5 million EXP, 15,000 tower coins

Failure: You cannot return to your original place until the quest is completed.

“Huh?!”

As the number of locusts decreased, they transformed back into Red Locusts.

***

[The population of the Purple Locusts on the 67th floor of the tower has been reduced to below 7 billion.]

[The population of the Purple Locusts on the 67th floor of the tower has met the devolution condition.]

[The Purple Locusts on the 67th floor of the tower have devolved into Red Locusts.]

“Hehehe. It’s Sejun, as expected!”

Aileen laughed, looking at the alert appearing on the crystal orb.

“Ah! This is not the time.”

Aileen had been examining the powers she could grant to Sejun’s Mid-level Administrator’s Tower badge. It was information she learned while learning about the responsibilities of the administrator from Kaiser.

<Power: Unfading Magic>

<Power: Ruler of the Wind>

…

..

.

<Power: Indestructible Body>

While Aileen was contemplating which powers to give Sejun…

[The population of the Red Locusts on the 67th floor of the tower has been reduced to below 6 billion.]

The number of Red Locusts was rapidly decreasing.

“Sejun is weak, so this would be best, right?”

Aileen chose the power to grant to Sejun’s Mid-level Administrator’s Tower badge.

[The <Power: Indestructible Body> is granted to the Mid-level Administrator’s Tower badge.]

Aileen was always worried about Sejun’s weak body, So she chose this power.

***

“So, Elka and Tamuro, go back and spread the rumor that the number of locusts has decreased, and if Tariq comes, catch him on the spot.”

“Yes!”

“Yes!”

Since it was not difficult to kill locusts even without the help of lizardmen or wolves, Sejun told them to catch Tariq who fed the Red Locusts and exacerbated the situation.

“If you use this, you can record evidence.”

Iona handed a small necklace to Tamuro.

After sending the wolves and lizardmen back to the waypoint…

“Let’s rest.”

Sejun and the animals went to bed. Starting with this morning’s hunt in the western forest, it had been a long day.

The next morning.

“Uhm…”

Sejun woke up feeling heavy.

And he began to remove what was making his body heavy.

“Ugh.”

First, he loosened the arms of Cuengi, who was sleeping behind him.

Then he removed the Black Rabbit and ChuChu, who were sleeping on his stomach, and Theo and Iona on his lap.

Seeing the Black Rabbit and ChuChu sleeping together gave him an inexplicable sense of betrayal, but he tried hard to ignore it.

“Let’s get up.”

Sejun put the animals he removed on Cuengi’s body and got up.

Just then.

Suddenly.

“Huh?”

Sejun felt something touch his knee as he lifted his leg.

“Meooow.”

Then, Theo, who was coming up along Sejun’s knee, clung tightly to his knee as if he wouldn’t let it go even in his sleep.

And,

“Kyoot.”

Just like Theo, Iona, who was gripping Theo’s tail, climbed up with him.

Dangling.

“Puhaha.”

Sejun burst into laughter looking at the two clinging to him even in his sleep. They were too cute.

Chuk.

Sejun grabbed Theo by the scruff of his neck to hang him properly on his knee.

And as he was about to go outside to check if the detoxifying green onions were growing well,

[The Tower’s Administrator grants <Power: Indestructible Body> to the Mid-level Administrator’s Tower Badge.]

“Indestructible Body?”

Sejun checked the black dragon tattoo on the back of his hand.

[Black Tower’s Mid-level Administrator’s Badge]

→ A badge proving that you are the Mid-level Administrator of the Black Tower

→ You have the authority to manage the Black Tower.

→ Power: <Indestructible Body>

<Power: Indestructible Body>

→ Your body is Indestructible.

“My body is Indestructible?”

Sejun took out his dagger. He wanted to test the new ability.

But,

“What if it hurts?”

Fear won over curiosity when he was about to test it by inflicting a wound on his arm with the dagger.

Whoosh.

Sejun put the dagger back and said,

“Ahem. This isn’t the time for this.”

He moved to where he had planted the detoxifying green onions.

“Wow.”

When he arrived at the place where he had planted 5,000 detoxifying green onions, he saw many green onions whose grades had risen and leaves had turned dark green.

“Good.”

Sejun began to harvest the upgraded detoxifying green onions.

[You have harvested the detoxifying green onion that slaughtered the swarm of poisonous insects.]

[99999 times left until job quest completion.]

[Job experience has slightly increased.]

[Proficiency of Harvesting Lv. 4 slightly increased.]

[You have gained 30 experience points.]

While he was harvesting the detoxifying green onions,

“Meow? President Park, where are we, meow?”

Theo woke up from sleep.

And then,

Twirl twirl.

“What, meow?”

Theo, discovered Iona sleeping while twirling his tail.

Shake shake.

Theo shook his tail hard to remove Iona, but Iona, who was sleeping using adhesive magic, did not fall off at all.

“Eeek!”

While Theo was trying to remove Iona, Sejun finished harvesting the detoxifying green onions.

“I’ll make something with this for breakfast.”

Sejun looked at the 1,000 detoxifying green onions he had harvested and said in a satisfied voice.

Sejun’s crops follow the principle that ‘crops of higher grade taste better’. If he cooked with this, he would create more delicious dishes with better options.

As Sejun was returning to the cave, imagining the taste of the dishes,

Squeak!!!

Kreong!!!

Black Rabbit & Cuengi, who just woke up from sleep, were running outside frantically calling for Sejun when they couldn’t find him around.
