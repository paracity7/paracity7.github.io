Chapter 69: Being Hated



TL: Hanguk

Aileen, who had fallen to the ground due to the Dragonheart rampage, opened her eyes.

“Am I… still alive…?”

Aileen moved her arms, legs, and wings to check her condition. Her body was fine.

“What about the Dragonheart?”

Aileen, who had just started to recover from her Dragonheart condition, focused on its beat with a nervous heart.

Thump, thump.

The heartbeat of the Dragonheart felt rhythmic.

“Huh?!”

The heartbeat of the Dragonheart was better than expected. It was much better than before it went berserk.

“How did this happen?”

Aileen checked the messages through the crystal orb to find out what had happened when she had passed out.

Then, seeing the message [Tower Farmer Park Sejun has completed the quest.], Aileen remembered that she had lost consciousness calling out Sejun’s name at the end.

“Ah… it’s a bit embarrassing…”

Aileen, even though she was not feeling hot, fluttered her wings and arms for no reason and checked the messages.

“It seems like the remarkable human saved me after all.”

Aileen felt happy thinking that Sejun had saved her. She felt sorry for her grandfather, but she was glad Sejun had saved her.

“Heeheehee.”

She couldn’t help but laugh.

“But… what is honey jelly?”

Aileen tried to remember the taste of honey jelly, but…

“Oh! I ate it when I fainted, so I don’t know what it tastes like.”

Aileen decided to get honey jelly from Sejun later to check its taste.

“No!”

But soon, she thought that she shouldn’t do that.

“As a Great Black Dragon, I owe him my life and am trying to get honey jelly as well!

It was not something a Great Black Dragon would do to get something else without paying off a life debt.

“Heehee. Then I’ll just repay him!”

Bang!

“Pritani collection warehouse open!”

Aileen kicked open the door of the collection warehouse and started looking for a gift for Sejun, examining the items collected by her ancestors.

But

[Apopis, the Magic Sword], [Gae Bolg], [Excalibur, the Holy Sword]…

“Heh… it’s disappointing. There’s nothing Sejun can use…”

There was no item that Sejun could use with his level and stats among the items on display in the collection warehouse.

Then

“Ah!”

A thing came to Aileen’s mind.

“Heeheehee. Wait for me, Sejun!”

Aileen, who came out of the collection warehouse, ran to the garden of the Tower Administrator’s area.

***

Sejun, who had prevented Aileen’s Dragonheart rampage, was eating dinner after finishing the harvest of cherry tomatoes, when

[The Tower’s Administrator thanks you for saving their life.]

Aileen woke up.

“Aileen, are you okay?”

[The Tower’s Administrator says they are better thanks to you.]

“That’s a relief. Eat this. It’ll help Aileen.”

Sejun handed over three honey jellies. Originally, there were five, but he gave one each to the mother Crimson Giant Bear and Cuengi.

[The Tower’s Administrator says it’s too shameful to keep receiving things.]

“Shameful? What about till now?”

[……]

[The Tower’s Administrator says they will at least repay the life debt.]

[A quest has been generated.]

[Quest: Shout ‘Aileen’ loudly to the sky.]

Reward: Something very big and good!

Refusal: Refusal is rejected!

“Something very big and good? What could that be?”

While Sejun was reading the reward and wondering,

“Puhuhut, I know what that very big and good thing is, meow!”

Theo, who was enjoying Churu from Sejun’s lap, shouted.

“What is it?”

“Puhuhut, President Park still doesn’t know the world of adults, meow!”

Theo got down from Sejun’s lap.

“Hey!”

Sejun quickly tried to stop Theo, sensing a crisis that he might see something unpleasant, but

“This is it, meow!”

Theo quickly pulled it out before Sejun could stop him.

“…Huh?! Is that the world of adults?”

“Yes, meow! Only adults can eat such big fish, meow!”

Theo proudly shouted while lifting a giant fish from a box on the floor with both hands. It was a yellowtail fish that appeared a few times outside the pond these days.

“Theo, have you ever been in a relationship?”

“Why… why are you suddenly asking that, meow?!! Meow! Oren! You rascal! I’ll get my revenge, meow!”

Thump! Thump! Thump!

Theo, reminded of his humiliating past where he was tricked by Oren into confessing his feelings to Maril because of Sejun’s relationship question, began throwing a tantrum.

“I shouldn’t have asked. I’m sorry…”

“Oren, you bastard! I’ll discipline you, meow!”

Thump! Thump! Thump!

While Theo was taking out his anger on the ground,

“Aileen!!!”

Sejun shouted Aileen’s name loudly towards the sky.

[You have completed the quest.]

[You have obtained a very big and good Aileen’s 100th birthday commemorative fountain as a quest completion reward.]

“Aileen’s 100th birthday commemorative fountain?”

Thud!

A huge vibration echoed as a large fountain was erected next to Sejun’s brick house.

At a glance, it was a circular tank with a diameter of 100m, made of high-quality black stone. And in the middle of the tank, there was a statue of a black dragon adorned with glittering red gems for eyes.

The black dragon statue roared with its mouth open in a dynamic posture as if it would move alive at any moment.

As Sejun was looking at the statue,

Flash.

The eyes of the black dragon statue lit up and

Swoosh.

Water streamed out from the mouth of the black dragon statue, making a beautiful rainbow.

Then,

Slowly.

The black dragon statue began to rotate 360 degrees slowly.

“Wow.”

Sejun exclaimed, approaching the fountain to take a closer look.

[Aileen’s 100th Birthday Commemorative Fountain]

→ This is a fountain that the great black dragon Kaiser Pritani ordered the dwarves to make in commemoration of Aileen Pritani’s 100th birthday.

→ All materials used are of high quality, made solely from black marble, and the Black Dragon statue was made by the dwarfs modeling after the appearance of the great Black Dragon Kaiser Pritani, the orderer.

→ The eyes of the Black Dragon statue used magic stones that the great Black Dragon Anton Pritani personally engraved magic on.

→ The fountain can create water itself or draw water from a source within a 10km radius.

→ The intensity, direction, and distance of the water spewing out can be freely adjusted.

→ Orderer: The Great Black Dragon Kaiser Pritani.

→ Creator: Dwarf King and his subordinates

→ Grade: S

→ Skills: [Water Production Lv. 50], [?????], [?????]

“There’s no usage restrictions?”

[The Tower’s Administrator says that since it’s an installation type item, there is no usage restrictions.]

“Ah! An installation type item?”

Sejun had only heard about such items.

[The Tower’s Administrator says that now you can reduce the time spent on watering.]

“Aileen, but why are the other skills question marks?”

[The Tower’s Administrator says it’s because their Grandfather did not provide that information.]

“So, how do I control the water?”

[The Tower’s Administrator says that if you touch anywhere on the fountain, a control screen appears for water adjustment.]

“Like this?”

When Sejun touched the wall of the fountain basin, the control screen appeared.

***

“Hmm… I don’t like it.”

The more Kaiser thought about Sejun, the more uneasy he felt. It was because his opportunity to see his granddaughter, which only came once every ten years, had disappeared because of this guy named Park Sejun.

“Father, calm down. Thanks to this human named Park Sejun, Aileen’s condition improved, didn’t it?”

Anton Pritani, Aileen’s father, smiled and said to Kaiser. Anton was greatly hopeful after viewing the emergency system’s activity records. It was the first time Aileen’s dragon heart improved rather than deteriorated after its rampage.

However,

“It’s also annoying! Really annoying!”

Kaiser did not like the fact that Aileen’s dragon heart, which had shown no improvement even when he intervened, had improved with Sejun’s help.

He wanted to resent him… but he owed him.

Yet, he didn’t like that either.

Like a pendulum, Kaiser’s heart swung between gratitude and resentment.

“I still need to give him a reward…”

As Kaiser was contemplating what to give Sejun as a reward for saving Aileen,

[The location of the Aileen’s 100th Birthday Fountain will be changed.]

[The Aileen’s 100th Birthday Fountain will be installed on the 99th floor of the tower.]

“What?! The 99th floor of the tower?”

The Aileen’s 100th Birthday Fountain was painstakingly built by Kaiser for his granddaughter, who was alone in the tower. But to install it on the 99th floor of the tower…

“Activate the video transmission system.”

[Activating the video transmission system of Aileen’s 100th Birthday Fountain.]

When Kaiser used the hidden skill, Video Transmission, to find out what was going on, the Black Dragon statue began to rotate 360 degrees, capturing and transmitting the surrounding video.

The video showed many monsters such as cats, rabbits, Crimson Giant Bears, and Black Minotaurs. And between them was one human. Kaiser felt like he knew who that human was as soon as he saw him.

“Argh! You! Park! Se! Jun!”

Kaiser’s pendulum swung towards resentment once again, and he became angry at Sejun, who had monopolized his granddaughter’s attention.

Aileen, this guy!

Is he really that great?! Great enough to give him the gift I gave?!

“Black dragon statue! Show him what you’re capable of!”

With Kaiser’s outcry, the gaze of the black dragon statue turned towards Sejun.

***

“Ah, so this is how you do it.”

As Sejun was watering the fields after learning how to control the fountain,

Thump.

Boom!

The black dragon statue suddenly changed its direction and started shooting water cannons at Sejun.

“Ugh! Why is this happening all of a sudden?!”

Sejun was taken aback by the sudden water baptism. Although it wasn’t painful, he couldn’t understand why it was happening.

“I hate water, Meow! President Park, dodge it quickly, Meow!”

Theo, who was hanging on Sejun’s knee and also got a water baptism, shouted at Sejun. Even while getting wet, he didn’t seem to want to let go of Sejun’s knee.  I will stay with Park Sejun’s knee till the end of the world, Meow!

Boom! Boom!

Sejun ran away to avoid the water cannons for now. Fortunately, the water cannon fired about 20 times and then stopped.

“Phew. What was that?”

Sejun used the fountain again to water the fields and went to bed.

And in the early morning.

Thump. Thump.

The tree branch scouts invaded again. It seemed that setting fire to the western forest had an effect as some of the tree branch scouts were charred black.

Unfortunately, He couldn’t receive the flame buff from Flamie.

Flamie’s leaves, which used the flame of purification and the flame of affinity, had turned white and yellow. Flamie said that the leaves need to turn green again to use the flame buff again.

“Let’s go, guys!”

“I’ll slaughter them, Meow!”

Squeak!

Kyung!

Sejun and the animals ran out to defeat the tree branch scouts.

However,

Roar!!!

The battle ended as soon as the mother Crimson Giant Bear roared at the enemies. With just one roar from the mother Crimson Giant Bear, the tree branch scouts turned into dust.

The mother Crimson Giant Bear, whose talents were enhanced after eating a honey jelly, had her talent of mana roar, which was close to its growth limit, evolved into a powerful mana roar.

“Well… let’s go back to sleep.”

“Let’s do that, Meow…”

Squeak…

Kyung…

The four who could not make a move trudged back into the house.

And

Roar?

The mother Crimson Giant Bear lay back down, scratching her head, wondering if she had killed the enemies too quickly.

And Sejun, who didn’t have to fight in the morning, woke up early for the first time in a while.

“Alright! Aileen, tonight’s going to be fine, right?”

[The Tower’s Administrator tells you to trust them.]

On the 241st day of being stranded, Sejun’s ninth Blue Moon was approaching.
